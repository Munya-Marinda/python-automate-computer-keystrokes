# Python Automate Computer Keystrokes
This Python project automates the process of recording and executing keystrokes, designed to streamline repetitive tasks and speed up workflows.

### 1. **python-record-keystrokes**

The first part of the system is a Python script called `python-record-keystrokes`. This script records every keypress, including both regular key inputs and special actions like pasting text. It tracks each action and stores them in a JSON file for future use. Think of it as a "keystroke recorder" that captures your every move on the keyboard.

### 2. **recorded_keystrokes.json**

Once the keystrokes are recorded, they are saved in the `recorded_keystrokes.json` file. This file acts as a log, holding all the keypresses in a structured format, making it easy to replay the exact sequence of actions whenever needed. It includes details like the type of action (`press`, `release`, `paste`) and the associated keys or text, which allows for accurate automation when replaying the actions.

### 3. **python-execute-keystrokes**

The final step in the system is the `python-execute-keystrokes` script. This component is responsible for reading the recorded keystrokes from the JSON file and executing them exactly as they were recorded. Whether it’s pressing a key, releasing it, or pasting a block of text, this script replays the actions one by one, with small delays for realism.

Together, these elements work seamlessly to automate repetitive tasks, whether it's filling out forms, posting content, or navigating through software. It’s a powerful example of how Python can be used to automate mundane tasks and increase productivity.
